Title: Predicting Customer Purchases with Decision Tree Classifier
OVERVIEW:

This task aims to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. By analyzing features such as age, job, marital status, education, and previous marketing interactions, we aim to train a decision tree model to accurately classify whether a customer will make a purchase.

Task Implemented:

1] Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset and identify patterns.

2] Data preprocessing to clean, transform, and prepare the data for training the model.

3] Building a decision tree classifier using the scikit-learn library in Python.

4] Evaluating the performance of the classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5] Visualizing the decision tree to interpret the classification rules learned by the model.
